# IAM Access 

To manage users' access to the infrastructure resources is a good practice both as a server health safety and a cybersecurity matter, as it makes harder to gain admin access to those resources. In this section, it will be shown how to create your own **API Key** to use in many steps on this tutorial.

## Steps

1. Login in your IBM cloud account and go to your dashboard.
2. Click on the 'Manage' tab located in the top bar.
3. On the left menu, go to 'API keys'.
4. Finally, create your API key and keep it safe.

!!! Warning
    If by any means your API key leaks, it is **very import** to create a new one. Just follow the same steps above, but delete your old key.
